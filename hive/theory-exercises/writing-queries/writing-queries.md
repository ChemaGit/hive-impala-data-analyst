## WRITING QUERIES

### BASIC QUERIES

### OVERVIEW
````text
Let us get an overview of Basic Hive Queries.

    Let us make sure _retail database is created.
    Make sure orders and order_items tables are added in the database.
    SQL Clauses
        SELECT - Project fields or derived fields
        FROM - Specify Tables
        JOIN - Join multiple data sets. It can also be OUTER
        WHERE - To filter data
        GROUP BY [HAVING] - For group operations such as aggregation
        ORDER BY - To sort the data

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT FROM JOIN WHERE GROUP BY HAVING ORDER BY
````

### HIVE QUERY - EXECUTION LIFE CYCLE
````text
$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

Let us understand the execution life cycle of a query.

    Here is the query

SELECT order_item_order_id, sum(order_item_subtotal) AS order_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY order_item_order_id
LIMIT 10;

Once the query is submitted, this is what happens.

Syntax and Semantecs Check
Compile Hive query into Map Reduce application
Submit Map Reduce Application as one or more Job
Execute all the associated Map Reduce Jobs
````

### REVIEWING LOGS FOR HIVE QUERIES
````text
Let us go through the details related to logs for Hive Queries.

Once the query is submitted details will be logged to /tmp/OS_USER_NAME/hive.log by default.
As Hive will be running as Map Reduce jobs, we can actually go through Map Reduce Job logs using Job History Server UI.
We can also go to Job Configuration and get more details about run time details of associated Map Reduce jobs.
    Running Query
    Number of reducers
    Input Directory
    and any other run time property for the underlying Map Reduce jobs.

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

cd /tmp/training
view hive.log

Tracking URL = http://localhost.localdomain:8088/proxy/application_1567490171890_0101/

END AS actual_status
FROM orders o LIMIT 100;
````

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'CLOSED' LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_customer_id = 8827 LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_customer_id = '8827' LIMIT 10;

````

### BOOLEAN OPERATIONS SUCH AS OR & AND USING MULTIPLE FIELDS
````text
$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;


SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' OR order_status = 'CLOSED' LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' AND order_date = '2013-07-25 00:00:00.0' LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' AND order_date = '2013-07-25 00:00:00.0';

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE';

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM orders WHERE order_status <> 'COMPLETE' AND order_date = '2013-07-25 00:00:00.0';
````

### BOOLEAN OR VS IN
````text
$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status = 'COMPLETE' OR order_status = 'CLOSED' LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status IN('COMPLETE','CLOSED') LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status IN('COMPLETE','CLOSED', 'PENDING') LIMIT 100;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status NOT IN('COMPLETE','CLOSED') LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_status <> 'COMPLETE' AND order_status <> 'CLOSED' LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_status NOT IN('COMPLETE','CLOSED');

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_status <> 'COMPLETE' AND order_status <> 'CLOSED';
````

### FILTERING DATA USING LIKE OPERATOR
````text
$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date LIKE '2014' LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_date LIKE '2014';

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date LIKE '%-07-%' LIMIT 10;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE order_date LIKE '%-07-%';

SELECT order_date, COUNT(1) FROM orders WHERE order_date LIKE '%-07-%' GROUP BY order_date;
````

### BASIC AGGREGATIONS USING AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
````text
Let us see how we can use aggregate functions such as count, sum, min, max etc.

Here are few examples with respect to count.

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT count(1) FROM orders;
SELECT count(DISTINCT order_date) FROM orders;
SELECT count(DISTINCT order_date, order_status) FROM orders;

Let us see functions such as min, max, avg etc in action.

SELECT * FROM order_items WHERE order_item_order_id = 2;

SELECT sum(order_item_subtotal) 
FROM order_items 
WHERE order_item_order_id = 2;

SELECT sum(order_item_subtotal),
  min(order_item_subtotal),
  max(order_item_subtotal),
  avg(order_item_subtotal)
FROM order_items 
WHERE order_item_order_id = 2;
````

### PERFORMING BASIC AGGREGATIONS SUCH AS SUM, MIN, MAX, ETC USING GROUP BY
````text
Let us get an overview of GROUP BY and perform basic aggregations such as SUM, MIN, MAX etc using GROUP BYâ€¦

It is primarily used for performing aggregate type of operations based on a key.
When GROUP BY is used, SELECT clause can only have those columns/expressions specified in GROUP BY clause and then aggregate functions.
We need to have key defined in GROUP BY Clause.
Same key should be specified in SELECT clause along with aggregate function.

Let us see aggregations using GROUP BY in action.

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT * FROM order_items LIMIT 10;

SELECT order_item_order_id,
  sum(order_item_subtotal) AS order_revenue,
  min(order_item_subtotal) AS min_order_item_subtotal,
  max(order_item_subtotal) AS max_order_item_subtotal,
  avg(order_item_subtotal) AS avg_order_item_subtotal,
  count(order_item_subtotal) AS cnt_order_item_subtotal
FROM order_items
GROUP BY order_item_order_id
LIMIT 10;


SELECT order_date, COUNT(DISTINCT order_status) distinct_status
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date;

SELECT order_date,order_status, COUNT(DISTINCT order_status) distinct_status
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date, order_status
LIMIT 10;
````

### FILTERING POST AGGREGATION USING HAVING
````text
Let us see how we can filter the data based on aggregated results using HAVING Clause.

Having clause can be used only with GROUP BY
We need to use function as part of HAVING clause to filter the data based on aggregated results.

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT order_item_order_id,
  sum(order_item_subtotal) AS order_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY order_item_order_id
HAVING sum(order_item_subtotal) >= 500
LIMIT 10;
````

### GLOBAL SORTING USING ORDER BY
````text
Let us see how we can sort the data globally using ORDER BY.

When we sort the data using ORDER BY, only one reducer will be used for sorting.
We can sort the data either in ascending or descending order.
By default data will be sorted in ascending order.
We can sort the data using multiple columns.
If we have sort the data in descending order on a particular column, 
then we need to specify DESC on that column.

Let us see few examples of using ORDER BY to sort the data.

$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/retail_training

SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY order_customer_id
LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY order_customer_id, order_date
LIMIT 10;

SELECT * FROM orders
ORDER BY order_customer_id ASC, order_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
````

### OVERVIEW OF DISTRIBUTE BY
````text
$ jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/training_retail

SELECT order_item_order_id,sum(order_item_subtotal) AS order_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY order_item_order_id
LIMIT 10;

SELECT order_item_order_id,sum(order_item_subtotal) AS order_revenue
FROM order_items
GROUP BY order_item_order_id
DISTRIBUTE BY order_item_order_id
LIMIT 10;
````

### SORTING DATA WITH IN GROUPS USING DISTRIBUTE BY AND SORT BY
````text
$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/

Let us create database training_nyse if it is not already existing and then create table stocks_eod

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS training_nyse;
USE training_nyse;

CREATE TABLE stocks_eod (
  stockticker STRING,
  tradedate INT,
  openprice FLOAT,
  highprice FLOAT,
  lowprice FLOAT,
  closeprice FLOAT,
  VOLUME BIGINT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/training/CCA159DataAnalyst/data/nyse_all/nyse_data' INTO TABLE stocks_eod;

Let us try creating new table stocks_eod_orderby using stocks_eod data sorting by tradedate and then volume descending.

Create table stocks_eod_orderby
Set number of reducers to 8
Insert into stocks_eod_orderby from stocks_eod using ORDER BY tradedate, volume DESC
Even though number of reducers are set to 8, it will use only 1 reducer as we have ORDER BY clause in our query.
Here are the commands to create table stocks_eod_orderby and insert data into the table.

CREATE TABLE stocks_eod_orderby (
  stockticker STRING,
  tradedate INT,
  openprice FLOAT,
  highprice FLOAT,
  lowprice FLOAT,
  closeprice FLOAT,
  VOLUME BIGINT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

SET mapreduce.job.reduces=8;

INSERT INTO stocks_eod_orderby
SELECT * FROM stocks_eod
ORDER BY tradedate, volume DESC;

Now let us create the table stocks_eod_sortby where data is grouped and sorted with in each date by volume in descending order.

Create table stocks_eod_sortby
Set number of reducers to 8
Insert into stocks_eod_sortrby from stocks_eod using DISTRIBUTE BY tradedate SORT BY tradedate, volume DESC
Now data will be inserted into stocks_eod_sortby using 8 reducers.
Data will be distributed/grouped by tradedate and with in each tradedate data will be sorted by volume in descending order.
Data need not be globally sorted on the tradedate.

Here are the commands to create table stocks_eod_sortby.

CREATE TABLE stocks_eod_sortby (
  stockticker STRING,
  tradedate INT,
  openprice FLOAT,
  highprice FLOAT,
  lowprice FLOAT,
  closeprice FLOAT,
  VOLUME BIGINT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';

Let us take care of inserting the data using DISTRIBUTE BY and SORT BY.

SET mapreduce.job.reduces=8;

INSERT INTO stocks_eod_sortby
SELECT * FROM stocks_eod
DISTRIBUTE BY tradedate
SORT BY tradedate, volume DESC;

Now we can look into the location of the table and we will see 8 files as 8 reducers are used.
