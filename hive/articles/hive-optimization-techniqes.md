# HIVE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES
````text
Apache Hive is a query and analysis engine which is built on top of Apache Hadoop and uses MapReduce Programming Model. 
It provides an abstraction layer to query big-data using the SQL syntax by implementing 
traditional SQL queries using the Java API. 
The main components of the Hive are as follows:

    - Metastore
    - Driver
    - Compiler
    - Optimizer
    - Executor
    - Client

While Hadoop/hive can process nearly any amount of data, but optimizations can lead to big savings, 
proportional to the amount of data, in terms of processing time and cost. 
There are a whole lot of optimizations that can be applied in the hive. 
Let us look into the optimization techniques we are going to cover:

    - Partitioning
    - Bucketing
    - Using Tez as Execution Engine
    - Using Compression
    - Using ORC Format
    - Join Optimizations
    - Cost-based Optimizer
